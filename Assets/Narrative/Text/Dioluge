Chorise:
Speak O Melpomene

Of that great tragedy

That ryls you in ire

Of bone 

And ash

Fading of heros fire 

Speak of he who 
for sings the bird

Of he who the 
brook weeps

Of he Whos loss
lements the wind.

He looked back
Never look back

PC: “What a mess.”

PC: “Hello”.

Hrm35: "Did you find her?"

Pc: “ I managed to track her IP address through the DNS,
but I haven't been able to track her any further than this host router. 
It seems to be running a Protocol Relay: Subterranean Processing & Hosting Network,
but Im having a hard time validating the certificates."

Hrm35: “I told you, those security certificates are tough nuts to crack,
especially on those ancient PR:SPHN”

PC: “Hold on, I think the network admin is on to me.”

Network Admin: “You are not authorized on this server, Im afraid Im going to have to boot you.”

PC: "threeFive, do you know anything about these admin bots?"

Hrm35: "Legacy or New Age?"

PC: “Just a moment, I'll get back to you.”

PC:" Legacy"

PR:SPHN: “Err...Code 508:Loop Detected”

PC: “Woh! Who, what was that?”!

Hrm35: "What, who?!"

Pc: "I think there's a rogue AI in chat."

Hrm35: "Hold on, let me log in and see what I can find out.

Orpheus… I can't find anything on her… It's like she was never here."

Ceuthonymus: “You should not be here, boy.”

Ceuthonymus: "This is no place for living souls.”

Hecotie (listed as ???): “Make your choice”

Pc: “ThreeFive, she's back.”

Hrm35:Orphious! That's a key card! Think of what we could do to the server with one of those! 

PC: "I Know, I Know."

Hrm35:How would you use it?”

Hecate (listed as ???): “chose”


PC: "But who is she?"

Hrm35: "I don't know, I can't seem to get a good trace on her 
address... and she's gone"

PC:”:...”

Hrm35: Orpheus. Are you ok? You've been quieter than usual; you used to be so full of pep and song 

PC:”…”

PC:” Yeah…sorry, I'm fine. It just occurred to me….”

Hrm35:” …”

PC”…”

Hrm35:” What just occurred to you? “

PC:” I might not make it out of here alive.”

Hrm35: “That just occurred to you!?!”

PC:” Is that a cat?”

Hem35:" Yeah, they were testing pet uploads a few years ago. 
Compression is no longer just a human tragedy…"

It's harmless... Probably."

Pc: “I think it wants me to follow it.”

Hrm35: “Don't follow the cat!

Hecate(speaking through cat) “meow”

PC: “I'm going to follow it. “

Hrm35: “Don't do it!!”

PC:” If it leads to death, it will be worth it if it just leads to her.”
