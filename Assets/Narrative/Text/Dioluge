Hrm35: "Did you find her?"

Pc: “ I managed to track her IP address through the DNS,
but I haven't been able to track her any further than this host router. 
It seems to be running a Protocol Relay: Subterranean Processing & Hosting Network,

especially on those ancient PR:SPHN”

PC: “Hold on, I think the network admin is on to me.”

Network Admin: “You are not authorized on this server, Im afraid Im going to have to boot you.”

PC: "Herm, do you know anything about these admin bots?"

Hrm35: "Legacy or New Age?"

PC: “Just a moment, I'll get back to you.”

PC:" Legacy"

PC: "But who is she?"

Hrm35: "I don't know, I can't seem to get a good trace on her 
address"
