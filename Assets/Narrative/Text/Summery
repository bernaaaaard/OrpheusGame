In the far near future, humans have found away to connect there conssisnus to a Network for the purpose of- 
surfing it.  Human consensus takes a large amount of space so as an impotant part of network architecture, 
Hadis is created to garbedge collect any unused assets,
including human consciousnesses that have lost their host body.

Our protagonist is a talented hacker by the name Orpheus. One stormy night, his wife gets on to the network, their home gets struck by lightning, and she dies.

Our distressed Orpheus logs in to go retrieve her from the ‘underwold’, a server run by a mysterious nameless Admen and an Ai named PR: SPHN(Protocol Relay: Subterranean Processing & Hosting Network) who continuously gains more awarnaes as the story continues.
This is also a grand opportunity as this garbage collection server is the resting place of a large amount of forbidden knowledge that can be used to collapse the shadow government.(Death is an opportunity after all)


Our hero must overcome the dangers of the underworld server in order to free his wife, as he is guided by his frind Hrm35: (a tech savvy geek who knows people) and his own personal Ai accestent Hecate, who helps guide him through the codebase.
