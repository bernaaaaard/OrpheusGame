Hello.
Hrm35
Did you find her?
Orpheus
I managed to track her IP address through the DNS, but I haven't been able to track her./any further than this host router./seems to be running a Protocol Relay: Subterranean- Processing & Hosting Network, but Im having a hard time validating the certificates.
Hrm35
I told you, those security certificates are tough nuts to crack, especially on those ancient PR:SPHNs
Orpheus
Hold on, I think the network admin is on to me

ThreeFive... she's back
Hrm35
Orpheus! I know who she is! It's a path-finding algorithm, not just any algorithm! This is the goddess of paths!
Hrm35
That's a key card! Think of what we could do to the server, the things we could get in to with one of those!

Hrm35
Orpheus. Are you ok? You've been quieter than usual; you used to be so full of pep and song.
Orpheus

Hrm35
What just occurred to you?
Orpheus
I Might not make it out of this alive
Hrm35
That Just Occurred To you?!?
Orpheus
Is that a cat?
Hrm35
Yeah, they were testing pet uploads a few years ago. Compression is no longer just a human tragedy… Its harmless
Hrm35
...Probably
Cat

Orpheus

Orpheus
If it leads to death, it will be worth it if it just leads to her
